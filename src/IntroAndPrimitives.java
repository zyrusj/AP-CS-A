Vocabulary
Computer Science (CS): used to encompass many aspects of computing, generally focused on development.
CS fives you the tools to write statements (code) that will ideally make the user's experience
both functional and enjoyable

Programming style: the layout of your code including the way variables are named and

Comments: This

In-line/short comment: appear after or near a statement and are preceded by two forward slashes ("//")
They have no impact on how your code functions but have notes for anyone that reads the code

Long comment: a comment that spans multiple lines that. You can see this vocabulary block is a long comment

Identifiers: names given to represent data store in memory. So variables names

White space: open space that doesn't affect code added to enhance readability

Interpreter: enables the computer to understand java code since it only understands binary

Binary: code written in zeroes and ones. In java, your code is interpreter into binary

Compiling: Interpreting from a programming language to binary

Compile time error: If an error is found in the code from doing something the interpreter doesn't
understand (like naming an identifier with the first character being a number) it will stop compiling and send you an error

Logical error: An error where the code compiles correctly but doesn't give you the desired output. For example, a tip
calculator that tells you 20% tip on $100 is $15. Your program didn't ran but it didn't give you the right output

Run time error: An error that isn't caught by the compiler that occurs during the execution of the program. For example,
trying to get the third item in a list of two items.
